### Question: What is the best IDE to use when writing golang?

Keep in mind there is no right answer to this question, but I will give you a few great options and then you can choose for yourself.

Also, please note that some of the options listed below are not technically IDEs, but because of the many extensions and features you can add to them, the line becomes blurry between a text editor and an IDE.

### Option #1: VSCode

#### Price: Free

Visual studio code is an excellent choice for writing go code. It is developed by Microsoft and is update regularly. VSCode is technically a text editor, but you can compile and run your code from the built in terminal, and there are many great extensions for golang which allow you to use debugging, syntax highlighing, and autocomplete.

VSCode has many great themes you can install to customize the look and feel as well as a plethora of handy plugins for working with git, collaborating, displaying unique file icons, and more. One of the many advantages of using VSCode is that because it is a hybrid between an IDE and a text editor you can use it to create any type of file, so once you get used to it you'll never have to switch between editors again.

Overall I would give VSCode a 9/10 because of it's great support, abundance of extensions and themes, ease of use, and versatility.

### Option #2: GoLand
