### What we're going to do

In this article we are going to walk through how to use react with a ruby on rails application. We will first create an initial rails appliction and then add the necessary gems and perform the necessary setup in order to get react to work with rails. At the end of this tutorial, you should have a rails application set up to work with react and will be able to extend this app to a full scale working application. You will be able to use reusable react components and mix and match erb with react as needed.

```ruby
def this_should_be_highlited
  x = 7
  y = {hi: 'hello'}
  z = [1,2,3]
end

class Bob
  extend Sweet::Nugget
  include Awesome::Sauce

  def hi
    puts 'hi'
  end

  def self.hello
    puts "holla"
  end
end
```
