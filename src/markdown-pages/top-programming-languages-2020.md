### Question: What are the top programming languages for 2020 and beyond?

The tech space moves fast, and it can be difficult to determine which programming language(s) will offer you the best returns upon mastering. To help determine which programming languages will be the "top/best" for you to learn in 2020, I am going to break down what the "top" means.

For the purposes of this article, the "top" programming languages will currently be in high demand and will have a high probability of their demand going up in the future. Not only will the "top" programming languages have high demand, but they will allow you to get a high paying job in an industry where you can grow and develop valuable domain knowledge. This domain knowledge will further contribute to your future success.

#### Criteria for the top programming language
<ul class="pl-10 mb-5 mt-5 list-disc">
    <li class="mb-2 text-lg">High probability for growth in 2020 and beyond</li>
    <li class="mb-2 text-lg">Substantial median salary</li>
    <li class="mb-2 text-lg">Requirement for jobs in exciting and expanding industries</li>
    <li class="mb-2 text-lg">Potential for growth of valuable domain knowledge</li>
</ul>

Even with the definition of "top" as defined above, there is sure to be some personal bias when it comes to deciding what the "top" programming languages are. A lot of it will have to do with what type of projects you like to work on and in what type of work environment.

### 1. Python

<b>By looking at data from Stack Overflow, we can see that Python is set for a medioric rise in popularity.</b> Not only does Python have excellent growth potential, but it is also an in demand skill for some of the highest paying jobs in new and exciting industries.

A quick search on glassdoor shows us that most jobs requiring Python are for data scientists, web developers, and machine learning engineers. The domain knowledge one can learn from working in one of these jobs is extremely valuable, the companies that employee for these jobs usually have a "fun" startup culture and pay extremely well. <b>At the time of this article there were 778 jobs on glassdoor with salaries between $64K-$214K for jobs requiring Python</b>

Not only is does python have some of the best projected growth, excellent jobs, and high pay, but it is also one of the easiest languages to pick up. It's interpreted nature means there is no need to deal with compiling or typing your variables. There are also hundreds of excellent beginner Python tutorials on youtube and around the web.
