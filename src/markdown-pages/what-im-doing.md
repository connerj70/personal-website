### I Will Do These Things To Become A Better Software Engineer.

#### 1. Practice Interview Questions.

I will use the book <a class="text-blue-500 no-underline- hover:underline" href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking The Coding Interview</a> as well as <a class="text-blue-500 no-underline- hover:underline" href="https://leetcode.com">leetcode</a> in order to improve my problem solving skills and practice the types of questions I will be faced with during interviews.

My plan is to do atleast one leetcode or Cracking The Coding Interview question per day, and 3 on the weekends. Doing this will keep my skills sharp and allow me to be ready for whatever challenges I may be given in the future and help me keep my skills sharp.

#### 2. Improve My Resume.

I will rewrite my resume and get it professionally checked before submitting it to employers.

I will also work on a legitimate side project that I can link to from my resume that will demonstrate my proficiency in software engineering.

#### 3. Attend Meetups and Other Networking Events.

Attending meetups and networking events is fun and also a great opportunity to learn from other software engineers. This will also help me keep a finger on the pulse of the industry and understand current trends.

#### 4. Write On This Blog.

This blog can be my second resume showcasing my desire to learn new things. I will write posts about what I am learning and try to help others learn as well. Through doing this I will increase my understand as well as help out the community by providing learning resources.

#### Conclusion.

Practicing interview questions, improving my resume, attending meetups, and writing on this blog are the main four things I am going to be doing over the next two years in order to become a better software engineer.

Let me know if there is something else I should be doing or share with me what you are doing to improve yourself over the next two years.
